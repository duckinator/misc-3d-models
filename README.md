# Miscellaneous 3D Models

Various models I made for 3D printing, when they aren't complex enough to justify their own repo.

## window-fan-spacer

3D printed spacers for my Sharper Image AIRBAR PORTAL window fan.

These are loosely based on the shape of the ones that came with the fan, but with some changes to account for different window designs.
